=======

Aulasis is a little CMS to manage the workflow of students in a
classroom. You can use Aulasis to publish the activities  using [Emacs
org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) syntax (a Markdown similar tag
language) and they send you the assignments throught a web form. 

Aulasis uses your filesystem to store the information, and it has been
designed to run on a USB memory.
